      "Remember: if you are feeling it, then it is real. There is no room in your heart for guilt or anger towards yourself regarding your feelings. You are not conjuring these feelings - they are real. What you really need - is someone to talk to about them.",
      "Reach out to an adult that you trust. This might be a parent, a teacher, a coach, a church leader, a counselor, or more. Speaking with someone who cares is the best way to overcome any personal battles - it’s the first step in helping the trauma feel less concentrated and more conquerable.",
      "If you’ve felt really lonely, recently, try giving the Emotional Listening Support Hotline a call: (717) 394-2000. The volunteers here are not counselors, and won’t give advice, but they have been trained in active listening.",
        "Similarly, you can reach out to the Samaritans HelpLine: (877) 870-4673. They are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by phone or text - and their goal is to provide compassionate support to all who need it.",
        "Even if you are extremely busy - try carving out 15 minutes of your day to focus on nothing but you. Put away all distractions, let yourself detach from all you have to do - and just let yourself enjoy (or at least feel peace) doing something you love for those 15 minutes (or 30 minutes, if you can spare it). Then you can jump back into your responsibilities - knowing that you will give yourself another 15 minutes the next day.",
        "If you feel up for it, try smiling. Even on days where we just don’t feel like smiling - the very act of smiling itself can help us feel lighter, freer, and happier. Try holding a smile for 5 - 10 minutes, and see how it feels.",
        "Just a friendly reminder that you, @User, are remarkable. No one else has tried living the life you are currently living - and you are one of a kind for that. Try and take time to remember how amazing you are this week.",
        "And always remember: You're doing better than you think you are."

        "Just know, these feelings are completely understandable and nothing to be ashamed of.",
        "However, we’re here to tell you, @User, that you deserve to feel peace, and hope. Take a look at the recommended next steps, to see if any might be of help or comfort.",
        "If you still find yourself unsure of what to do, please send us a message or give us a call at (602) 992 - 3510."

        "Have you remembered to treat yourself this week? You deserve a break or a nice treat every once in a while! Try to make sure you make some time for YOU this week (even if it's just 15 minutes). You deserve it.",
        "Have you had some quality time with your family or any close friends in the past week? If not, see if you can find time during this upcoming week! Our relationships are so important - and you deserve to spend quality time for people that love you for who you are.",
        "If life starts feeling overwhelming - too many things to handle/juggle - maybe try your hand with scheduling. Google Calendars, Fantastical, and Any.Do are some free applications currently available! Instead of trying to juggle too many tasks in your mind, writing the tasks down can relieve you of the effort required to constantly remember your next 'to-do' task.",
        "As life comes and goes in waves, just remember that any thoughts, fears, or stresses you are having are okay and normal to have. But if they feel too hard to handle on your own, please always remember to reach out to others. Family, friends, mentors - these people care about you and want you to succeed.",
        "If you ever feel too stressed to reach out to personal contacts, you could always try reaching out to this number for help, as well: (877) 870-4673. This is the Samaritan HotLine and they are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by phone or text; their goal is to provide compassionate support to all who need it.",
